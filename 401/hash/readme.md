# Hashtables
Array that each value contains a data structure in our example linkedilst that has one or more 

## Challenge
Testing , imagine it 
## Approach & Efficiency
Linkedlist for each key in the hashmap 

## API
class node to be used in linkedlist class , prepend to prepend new nodes to the linkedlist ,, hashmap class ,, establish an array to store the data hash and select size , hash function for generate a key  by summation of asci code *19 module the size of the array to make sure it's not bigger than the sizxe ,, set for adding a new value to the hasharray if there was no key before will be creating a linkedlist and add the object with the key and the value to it , if there is just add it to the linkedklist in the key,,, an array that contains linkedlist with multi values each value is an object  ,, contains return true if there is a key O/(1), get returns value associated with the key after finding the element in the hashed array we will go through the linked list looking for the requested key if it's found we will break the loop and return the value time comp[lexity O(n)
