# Trees
data structure that has a node each node is designed to contain a value and some other nodes , example n binary tree at most two nodes left,right.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The execution process of recursive , imagining what happen in the background
## Approach & Efficiency
In order , pre order , postorder 

## API
In order , pre order , postorder  traverse tree elements in different ways
Add in binarysearch class , will add the corrrect item to the tree 
search ,Will search for an item using binary search return true if its found complexity for search , add(Olog(n))
